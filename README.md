# SummerPrinter

Here you will find information about our 3D printer design, which we are building in summer camps in 2019 and will be using in camps and workshops going forward.

At present only basic information is here -- .stl files for the 3D printed parts of the printer, and configuration files for firmware set up for this printer's hardware.  Documentation and updates will be forthcoming!
