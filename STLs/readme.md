This directory contains .stl files needed to make the 3D printed components of the printer.  Documentation is lacking at the moment; if you have attended our camp then these will be useful for reprinting any parts that break or modifying an existing part.  If you have not had the experience of building this printer already, it will be puzzle to figure out how it all goes together!

ATX Mount* files are for mounting a desktop computer ATX power supply to the printer frame for the printer's power supply.
PS* files are for mounting a Meanwell 12V/29A power supply.  You only need to print one of these two sets of files, depending on your hardware.
