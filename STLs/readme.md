This directory contains .stl files needed to make the 3D printed components of the printer.

All files should print successfully without support.  Files are oriented in the best printing orientation, with positive Z being vertically up on the printer.  In general, parts associated with the motion system should be printed in ABS with four perimeters and generous infill.

ATX Mount* files are for mounting a desktop computer ATX power supply to the printer frame for the printer's power supply.
PS* files are for mounting a Meanwell 12V/29A power supply.  The tall bottom cover is for use with power inlets that use blade connectors that need a bit more space.
You only need to print one of these two sets of files, depending on your hardware.

Drill bushing holder.stl is tooling -- use it with 5mm ID drill bushings to cross-drill extrusion pieces at the correct locations if your extrusions are not already cross-drilled.
Z * spacer.stl files are also tooling, used to align the top and bottom anchors for the Z shaft such that the shaft is vertical.

Extruder mount.stl is needed only if you have an MK8-style extruder that did not come with a mounting bracket.
Mobius mount.stl can be used to mount a Voron Mobius 3 extruder vertically in the place of an MK8-style extruder.

Frame spacer.stl is needed only if you discover at the last minute that your Z-axis smooth rods are about 3mm longer than they should be and they don't fit in the frame!

Bed Standoff.stl is needed to mount the print bed only if you discover at the last moment that your mounting screws are significantly longer than the bed springs!

MKS* files are for mounting MKS-base electronics to the printer frame.
RAMPS* files are for mounting an Arduino Mega + RAMPS boards to the printer frame.
SKR 13* files are for mounting SKR 1.3 electronics to the printer frame.
You only need to print one of these three sets of files, depending on your hardware.

Panel clip.stl is optional, use several of these to attach coroplast sheets to the outside of your frame, if desired.

X carriage duct.stl may need to be printed with fewer perimeters than the other parts -- 2 perimeters or 0.8mm wall thickness -- to get the roof to print successfully.  Check the print preview in your slicer before printing and make sure the infill lines extend all the way to the walls on the first layer of the roof.

Cable Clip* files are used to secure the printer wiring in place.  Expect to use at least four of each size; having more won't hurt.  Be sure to print these in ABS; if printed in PLA the plastic will creep over time and become loose in the frame extrusions.

Foot.stl is optional, you can use any sort of rubber feet on the bottom of the printer instead.  If you use these printed feet, be sure to print them in ABS; if printed in PLA they will sag or crack over time.  It would be interesting to try printing them in TPU.
