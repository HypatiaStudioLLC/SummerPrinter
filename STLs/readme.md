This directory contains .stl files needed to make the 3D printed components of the printer.  Documentation is lacking at the moment; if you have attended our camp then these will be useful for reprinting any parts that break or modifying an existing part.  If you have not had the experience of building this printer already, it will be puzzle to figure out how it all goes together!

ATX Mount* files are for mounting a desktop computer ATX power supply to the printer frame for the printer's power supply.
PS* files are for mounting a Meanwell 12V/29A power supply.  You only need to print one of these two sets of files, depending on your hardware.

Drill bushing holder.stl is tooling -- use it with 5mm ID drill bushings to cross-drill extrusion pieces at the correct locations if your extrusions are not already cross-drilled.

Extruder mount.stl is needed only if you have an MK8-style extruder that did not come with a mounting bracket.

Frame spacer.stl is needed only if you discover at the last minute that your Y-axis smooth rods are about 3mm longer than they should be and they don't fit in the frame.
