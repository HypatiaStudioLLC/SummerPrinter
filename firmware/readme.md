This directory contains firmware configuration files -- at present, there is only one that is set up for Marlin running on Arduino Mega + RAMPS + A4988 drivers.
To use configuration.h, first download and install the Arduino development environment (IDE) from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software .
Then, get version 1.1.9 of Marlin firmware from http://marlinfw.org/meta/download/ and unzip it into a directory on your computer.
Replace the configuration.h file in that download with the file from this directory, which is already configured for this printer's hardware.
If you'd like to alter anything in the firmware, start by reading Marlin's excellent documentation at http://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/configuration.html .
